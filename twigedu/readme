The goal of this exercise is to write some executable code.

Given an array of length >= 0, and a positive integer N, return the contents of the array divided into N
equally sized arrays.
Where the size of the original array cannot be divided equally by N, the final part should have a length equal
to the remainder.

Execute as follows to show usage:

I suppose Python path is already in your system PATH.
These commands run on the project folder wherever you saved.
(in my case "D:\venv37\twigedu")

PS D:\venv37\twigedu> python -m twig

PS D:\venv37\twigedu> python -m unittest tests/test_devide_chunks.py
